## Dataset 📊
- **Sales Data**: Historical transactional records containing sales volume, price, and related features.
- **Pricing Data**: Information on pricing strategies, discounts, and promotions.

## Objectives 🚀
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand sales trends and pricing impacts.
- Build **predictive models** to forecast weekly sales volumes.
- Provide **data-driven pricing recommendations** to optimize revenue and customer demand.

## Approach 🔍
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Feature engineering for improved model accuracy.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
